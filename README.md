Project Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
The Real-time COVID-19 Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool built using Tableau. It displays up-to-date global COVID-19 data like vaccination rates—providing users with clear insights into the pandemic’s progression. Data is sourced from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Data Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), ensuring that the information remains current and accurate.

------------------------------------------------------------
What I Did
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Data Sourcing & Integration
   - Data Source:
     The project uses the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Data Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as its primary data source, which is renowned for its comprehensive and 
     frequently updated global statistics.
   
   - Data Preparation:
     The data was cleaned and formatted prior to importing into Tableau. This preprocessing step (which could be executed via Python or directly within Tableau) ensured that the data 
      was ready for effective visualization and analysis.

2. Dashboard Design & Development
   - Tool Used:
     Tableau was selected for its powerful visualization capabilities and ease of connecting to live data sources.
   
   - Interactive Visualizations:
     - Maps: Geographical maps display the distribution of COVID-19 cases globally, making it easy to identify regions most affected.
     - Trend Charts: Time-series graphs and trend lines illustrate how cases, deaths, and vaccination rates evolve over time.
     - Filters & Parameters: Interactive filters allow users to drill down by country, region, or date range, offering a tailored view of the data.
   
   - Real-time Updates:
     The dashboard is configured to update as new information becomes available from the Johns Hopkins repository, ensuring that the displayed statistics are always current.

3. Technical Implementation
   - Data Connection:
     Tableau is set up to connect directly to the data source. This connection might be configured as a live connection or scheduled for regular data refreshes.
   
   - Visualization Techniques:
     - Color Coding: Differentiates severity levels (e.g., low to high case counts) for intuitive understanding.
     - Tooltips: Provides additional details when hovering over data points.
     - Dashboards & Stories: Combines multiple visualizations into a coherent layout that effectively narrates the impact of the pandemic.

4. User Experience & Insights
   - Interactive Analysis:
     Users can explore global statistics, regional differences, and temporal trends through interactive elements, making the dashboard valuable for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.
   
   - Data-Driven Decision Making:
     By offering real-time visualization of COVID-19 data, the dashboard serves as a vital tool for informed decision-making in public health and research.

Summary of the Project
------------------------------------------------------------
This project documents the entire process of creating the Real-time COVID-19 Dashboard:

- Motivation:
  To provide an accessible, real-time visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic using reliable data.
  
- Methodology:
  Data was sourced from the Johns Hopkins repository, preprocessed, and integrated into Tableau for visualization.
  
- Design Decisions:
  Interactive maps, trend charts, and filters were employed to ensure users can easily navigate and understand the data.
  
- Technical Implementation:
  The dashboard leverages Tableau's capabilities to establish live data connections and deploy dynamic visualizations.
  
- Outcomes & Insights:
  The final product offers clear insights into regional and global trends, aiding in data-driven analysis and decision-making.
  
- Future Enhancements:
  Plans for future improvements include integrating additional data sources (e.g., vaccination rollout details), refining visual aesthetics, and incorporating predictive analytics to forecast trends.

How to Use the Dashboard
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone the Repository:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   git clone https://github.com/uroojt6/COVID-19-vaccination-tracker-Dashboard.git

2. Open the Tableau Workbook:
   Launch Tableau and open the provided COVID19_Dashboard.twbx file.

3. Refresh the Data:
   - If a Python script or another data-fetching method is used, execute it to update the data.
   - In Tableau, refresh the data source to load the latest COVID-19 statistics.

4. Interact with the Dashboard:
   Use the available filters and interactive elements to explore the data based on region, time, or severity.
